## 🔧 **FURTHER OPTIMIZATIONS for CNN and Autoencoder:**

The CNN and Autoencoder models need additional optimization. Here are specific improvements:

### **CNN Model Issues & Solutions:**

**Problem**: CNN stuck at 22.13% accuracy (predicting all as minority class)
**Solutions**:
1. **Reduce model complexity** - too many parameters for dataset size
2. **Adjust learning rate** - start with 0.0001 instead of 0.001
3. **Fix architecture** - reduce parallel branches from 4 to 2
4. **Better initialization** - use Xavier/He initialization

### **Autoencoder Issues & Solutions:**

**Problem**: High reconstruction loss, poor classification
**Solutions**:
1. **Balance loss weights** - reduce reconstruction loss weight to 0.1
2. **Separate training phases** - pre-train autoencoder, then fine-tune classifier
3. **Anomaly threshold tuning** - use reconstruction error for detection
4. **Architecture adjustment** - smaller encoding dimension (32→16)
